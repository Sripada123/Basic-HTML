                Arkansas Tech University's Computer and Information Science
                program is designed to provide students with the fundamental
                knowledge and skills required to initiate and maintain a
                successful career in the information systems field. All
                students in our program are exposed to a variety of hardware
                platforms and programming languages. Hands on experience in
                the design and implementation of a complete information
                systems project is attained in the student's senior year.

                    The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science prepares students for careers as systems programmers in a
                    scientific and/or engineering environment and for graduate work in computer science. Mathematics and
                    engineering courses supplement a strong core of computer science courses, enabling students to design
                    and implement software that requires complicated computations, data structures, and interfaces.

                    The rise in cyber threats has created an unprecedented demand for cybersecurity specialists. Data
                    breaches, malware infections, and software vulnerabilities are common in today's technology and it is
                    critical to fully understand how these attacks occur, how to prevent them, and how to recover. A
                    cybersecurity major will understand techniques used as well as the best methods to protect data. The
                    cybersecurity degree includes courses in programming, wireless technologies, mathematics, and
                    networking concentrating on theory and hands-on experience.

                    The Bachelor of Science in Information Systems prepares students for careers as application 
                    programmers/analysts in a business environment and for further graduate work in information systems.
                    Business courses supplement a strong core of technical courses to enable students to design and
                    implement business process systems that require programming, databases, web development, networking,
                    and client-server processing.

                    The Master of Science in Information Technology is a study of the
                    hardware and software mechanisms used to implement modern information
                    systems.  It includes coverage of local-area networks, database,
                    operating systems, the Internet, and the web.  Particular emphasis 
                    is placed on the use of information systems in business and education.
                    The student is offered two specialty programs:  one in Computer-Based
                    Instructional Technology, and one in Information Technology.
                    Each program is built around a common core of three important 
                    technologies:  networking, web development, database design and 
                    implementation.
