                    <p>The Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) is a study of the hardware
                        and software mechanisms used to implement modern information systems. It includes
                        coverage of local-area networks, database, operating systems, the Internet, and the
                        web. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of information systems in business and
                        education. The student is offered two specialty programs: one in Computer-Based Instructional
                        Technology (CBIT), and one in Information Technology (IT).
                    </p>

                    <h5>Each Program Is Built Around A Common Core Of Three Important Technologies:</h5>

                    <blockquote>

                        <p>Networking<br>Web Development<br>Database Design &amp; Implementation
                        </p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The CBIT specialty program enables a student to complete the degree through course-work
                        directed to showing the application of computing technology to instruction.
                    </p>

                    <p>The IT specialty program is intended for students pursuing a career in technical support
                        for business information systems.
                    </p>

                    <h5>The Focus Is On An Integrated Study Of:</h5>
