                     <p>The College of Education provides guidance and professional courses for the teacher
                        candidate who plans to teach in elementary, middle level, and secondary schools. The
                        teacher education program is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation
                        of Teacher Education (NCATE).
                     </p>
                     <p>Teacher candidates who plan to teach physical education, elementary education, or
                        middle level must enroll in the College of Education. Those who elect to prepare for
                        teaching in other fields must enroll in schools appropriate to their interests in
                        teaching.
                     </p>
                     <p>For the freshman or sophomore teacher candidate who has not selected a major or specific
                        teaching level or area, the College recommends enrollment in the undeclared program
                        (see “Undecided Study”). In addition to taking the required general education courses,
                        teacher candidates in this program are encouraged to take such electives as will provide
                        them a good liberal education and help select a major field. Advisors in this program
                        are selected to provide guidance to undecided teacher candidates.

                     <p>In making a decision to enter the teaching profession, teacher candidates should seriously
                        consider the demands which this choice entails. Among these are scholarship and intellectual
                        curiosity; an interest in children and young people, and an understanding of their
                        interests, problems, and development; a thorough understanding of the principles and
                        skills employed by effective teachers; and an interest in and understanding of the
                        role of the school in our society.
                     </p>
                     <p>Teacher candidates who elect the professional program in teacher education will complete
                        their study in at least two stages. See the appropriate catalog section for the requirements
                        for specific programs. Some courses in the area of specialization should also be completed.
                        <strong>Admission to Arkansas Tech University is a prerequisite to, but separate from, admission
                           to teacher education.</strong> Declaration of a major in one of the University’s teacher education programs is also
                        a prerequisite to making formal application for admission to teacher education. Even
                        though admission to Tech and declaration of a teaching major are necessary conditions
                        for admission to teacher education, they are not the only requirements. Other criteria
                        are listed in the section below.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Admission &amp; Retention in Teacher Education at Tech</h2>
                     <p>Professional programs are composed of courses and experiences designed to complete
                        the undergraduate stage of professional preparation for teaching. Admission is by
                        application to the Admission and Retention Committee of the Teacher Education Council.
                        Before a teacher candidate may enroll in professional education courses at the upper
                        division level (the required 3000 and 4000 level professional education courses),
                        he or she must be formally admitted to teacher education at Tech. Application forms
                        may be obtained from the office of the Dean of the College of Education (Crabaugh
                        204) or the office of the Director of Teacher Education Student Services (Crabaugh
                        109).
                     </p>
                     <p>To be admitted to programs in secondary education, teacher candidates must have two
                        assigned advisors, one from the College of Education and one from the department representing
                        their teaching concentration, have the approval of both advisors, satisfactorily complete
                        the pre-admission requirements, have a cumulative grade point average of 2.70 on all
                        college work completed including transfer work, and submit a plan of study approved
                        by both advisors. An early childhood education or middle level education major will
                        have one advisor from the Department of Curriculum and Instruction. <strong>Admission to teacher education will be recommended by the academic advisors and determined
                           by the Admission and Retention Committee based on the following considerations: completion
                           of English composition courses, an oral communication course, a college-level mathematics
                           course, and the appropriate introductory education course with grades of “C” or higher,
                           and completion of the Core Academic Skills Test with scores equal to or greater than
                           the scores determined by the Arkansas Department of Education.</strong> Other factors which reflect professional competence, including moral and emotional
                        stability, physical and mental health, intellectual curiosity, use of English, social
                        awareness, and professional interest will be considered by the Admission and Retention
                        Committee. Formal screening and subsequent admission into teacher education and the
                        monitoring of satisfactory progress in the teacher preparation program represent institutional
                        obligations to the teaching profession, the schools served by and working with the
                        University’s programs, and the agencies that approve and accredit teacher education
                        programs. Once admitted to teacher education, the teacher candidate must maintain
                        satisfactory progress throughout the completion of the teacher education program according
                        to the standards cited above and any additional program standards in effect or lose
                        eligibility to continue in that program. Course sequences and prerequisites will be
                        followed carefully.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Admission Decision Appeals</h2>
                     <p>A formal appeal of a decision to deny admission to teacher education may be made to
                        the Admission and Retention Committee of the Teacher Education Council. Instructions
                        and forms for such appeals are available in the Office of the Dean of Education.<strong> An appeal should be based upon exceptional or extenuating circumstances and/or other
                           pertinent information not previously available or considered.</strong> A formal appeal must be submitted in writing to the Dean who will transmit it to
                        the Committee. The Committee’s decision may be appealed in writing to the Dean of
                        the College of Education regarding admission to teacher education. If the appeal is
                        not resolved at this level the teacher candidate may appeal to the Vice President
                        for Academic Affairs whose decision will be final.
                     </p>
                     <h2><a id="CriteriaInternship"></a>Criteria for Internship
                     </h2>
                     <p>Internship is normally expected to be the last requirement completed in teacher education
                        programs. Internship requires a full-time academic and professional commitment. Internship
                        requires the teacher candidate to devote one semester of the senior year to full-time
                        internship in an approved school. The teacher candidate should plan the work of internship
                        to provide one semester free of activities and responsibility which would interfere
                        with the requirements of the professional semester. The teacher candidate is expected
                        to follow the direction of the Field-Based Teacher, the School Principal, the Arkansas
                        Tech University Supervisors, and the Arkansas Tech University Director of Teacher
                        Education Student Services.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Admission requirements for secondary education include completion of all professional
                           education courses, a minimum grade of “C” in all courses required for the teaching
                           field and professional education, and a 2.50 grade point average in the courses required
                           for the teaching field with a cumulative grade point average of 2.70 on all work attempted,
                           including transfer work.</strong> Admission requirements for early childhood education and middle level education include
                        no grade below “C” in any course work with a cumulative grade point average of 2.50
                        on all work attempted, including transfer work. Internship admission requires a Praxis
                        II Specialty Area score which meets or exceeds the minimum scores established by the
                        Arkansas Department of Education.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Appeals of Internship Eligibility Decisions</h2>
                     <p>Decisions made regarding a teacher candidate’s eligibility and readiness for placement
                        or retention in internship may be appealed in writing to the Admission and Retention
                        Committee of the Teacher Education Council. Such an appeal should be submitted to
                        the Dean of the College of Education, who will transmit it to the Committee. The Committee’s
                        decision regarding an appeal may be appealed in writing to the Dean. If the appeal
                        is not resolved at that level, the teacher candidate may appeal to the Vice President
                        for Academic Affairs whose decision is final. Appeals should be based on exceptional
                        or extenuating circumstances and/or pertinent information not previously available
                        or considered.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Internship Application Process</h2>
                     <p>TEACHER CANDIDATES MUST SUBMIT A FORMAL APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION TO INTERNSHIP FOR
                        THE SPRING SEMESTER PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1 OF THE PREVIOUS FALL SEMESTER TO BE CONSIDERED
                        FOR THE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE. &nbsp;APPLICANTS FOR THE SPRING SEMESTER MUST SUBMIT THE
                        APPLICATION PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1 OF THE FALL SEMESTER. APPLICANTS FOR THE FALL SEMESTER
                        MUST SUBMIT THE APPLICATION PRIOR TO MARCH 1 OF THE SPRING SEMESTER. FAILURE TO MEET
                        THESE DEADLINES COULD RESULT IN THE DELAY OF INTERNSHIP FOR A SEMESTER. PRIORITY IN
                        INTERNSHIP PLACEMENT WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE TEACHER CANDIDATES MEETING THE DEADLINES
                        AND PREREGISTERING FOR INTERNSHIP FOR THE GIVEN SEMESTER.
                     </p>

                     <p>The Congress of the United States, in its reauthorization of Title of the Higher Educations
                        Act of 1998, enacted accountability measures requiring institutions of higher education
                        to report data to the public on the pass-rates of teacher candidates on assessments
                        required for state licensure. The pass-rates for 2008-2009 for Arkansas Tech University
                        teacher candidates were 100 percent on the assessments of basic skills, professional
                        knowledge, and academic content knowledge. The average pass-rates for programs in
                        the state were also 100 percent.
                     </p>
                     <p>Teacher candidates spend an average of 405 hours in the classroom during internship;
                        and the average faculty-teacher candidate ratio in supervised practice teaching is
                        5.0. All programs are approved by the Arkansas Department of Education. The teacher
