                     <p>The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BS-CS) program prepares students for
               careers as systems programmers in a scientific and/or engineering environment and
               for further graduate work in computer science. Mathematics and engineering courses
               supplement a strong core of computer science courses, enabling students to design
               and implement software that requires complicated computations, data structures, and
               interfaces.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Program Educational Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>The mission of the Department is to produce men and women who can assess, develop,
               and maintain business and scientific computing systems, and who are capable of continued
               learning and ethical practice in computing.
            </p>
            
            <!--<h6>In Accomplishing This Mission The Graduates Of The BS-CS Degree Program Will:</h6>-->
            
            <!--<blockquote>
<p>Communicate effectively using terminology and processes that are appropriate for the field</p>
<p>Work efficiently and effectively in a team environment to develop appropriate computer-based systems to satisfy stated requirements</p>
<p>Solve complex computational problems using appropriate models, techniques, and abstractions</p>
<p>Conduct themselves in a professional and ethically responsible manner</p>
<p>Learn new trends and technology and willingly adapt to new systems and software environments</p>
